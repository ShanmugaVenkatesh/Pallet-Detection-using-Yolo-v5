## RealSense pipeline
   It provides a unified **interface** to manage and process data from Intel RealSense depth cameras.
   The pipeline allows you to access various streams, such as color, depth, infrared, and more, simultaneously or individually, depending on your application's requirements.
## Features:
   1.###Configuration: 
   Before starting the pipeline, you need to create a configuration object (rs.config()) and specify the desired streams and their settings. This includes the resolution, format, frame rate, and other parameters for each stream. You can enable color, depth, infrared, and other streams based on your application needs.

   2.###Starting and Stopping:
            Once you have configured the pipeline, you can start it using the pipeline.start(config) method. This initializes the RealSense camera and begins capturing frames. The pipeline runs in a separate thread, continuously receiving and processing frames. To stop the pipeline and release the resources, you can use pipeline.stop().

   3.###Frame Retrieval: 
            The pipeline captures frames from the RealSense camera asynchronously. You can use the pipeline.wait_for_frames() method to block the execution until a new set of frames is available. This method returns a frameset object that contains all the captured frames. From the frameset, you can access individual frames using methods like frameset.get_color_frame(), frameset.get_depth_frame(), etc.

   4.###Frame Processing: 
            Once you have retrieved the frames, you can perform various operations on them, such as image manipulation, depth processing, object detection, and more. The RealSense SDK provides APIs and tools to process the frames efficiently. You can leverage libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and other computer vision frameworks to perform advanced processing tasks.

   5.###Synchronization: 
            The RealSense pipeline automatically synchronizes frames from different streams, such as color and depth, based on their timestamps. This ensures that the frames are aligned properly, making it easier to perform depth-based calculations or combine different streams for applications like augmented reality or 3D scanning.

   6.###Advanced Features: The RealSense pipeline supports additional features and capabilities, such as hardware synchronization, temporal filtering, spatial alignment, and more. These features allow you to enhance the quality of the captured data and improve the accuracy of your applications.
